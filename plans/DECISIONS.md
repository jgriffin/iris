### 2026-05-25 — Core ML detector: start with YOLOv12 (Path A), pluggable `OutputDecoder` seam

The PyTorch→Core ML toolchain is verified empirically (ultralytics 8.4.54, coremltools 9.0, M1 Max) and M6 wires it into Iris through **one `CoreMLDetector` with a swappable `OutputDecoder`**, not two detectors. **Start with YOLOv12** — it is the **true zero-decode Path A**: `yolo export … nms=True` yields an Apple `NonMaximumSuppression` pipeline with `coordinates`+`confidence` outputs and 80 COCO labels baked into the NMS stage, so Vision auto-decodes and `CoreMLDetector` + `VisionObjectDecoder` is a thin adapter with no Swift box-decode. (`nms` defaults to **false** — a bare export is Path B.) **YOLO26 is Path B, not A:** ultralytics *forces* `nms=False` on end2end models (warns *"'nms=True' is not available for end2end models"*), so it always exports as a raw `[1,300,6]` tensor needing a **trivial** `YOLOEnd2EndDecoder` — threshold + scale the ≤300 rows, **NO NMS** (the one-to-one head self-dedupes), labels from `userDefined` `names`. RF-DETR's `DETRSetPredictionDecoder` is a later additive plug-in through the same seam (off the critical path — see [`QUESTIONS.md`](./QUESTIONS.md)). Always verify the decode path against the exported artifact (`inspect_model.py`) before writing Swift — a doc-only pass got YOLO26's path wrong; the empirical re-run corrected it. Pin each model's fixed input size + aspect-preserving scale-to-fit (never hardcode 640). Caveat folded into M6's opens: `nms=True` bakes IoU/conf thresholds at export, so runtime-tunable thresholds would force Path B or a re-export.

### 2026-05-25 — VideoGeometry is the single coordinate-mapping authority

`VideoGeometry` (a pure `Sendable` value type: `contentSize` + `containerSize` + `contentMode` → `displayRect` + Y-flip) is now the one place normalized detection coordinates are mapped into view space, replacing the scattered `videoRect` math. It deliberately does **not** handle rotation or mirroring. By the time anything reaches the overlay, frames and detections are already **upright**: capture rotates the buffer on the `AVCaptureConnection` and stamps `.up`; Vision is given `frame.orientation` so its normalized coords are already in upright space; the player displays upright. So the overlay's only job is to place upright-normalized "truth" into the displayed (letterboxed / scaled / cropped) video "box" and flip Y — rotation and mirroring are source-level concerns. This reverses an earlier same-day exploratory direction that built rotation + mirror into the geometry; the static preview gallery surfaced that as the wrong layer (an architecture catch, not a pixel one). `DetectionLayer` now takes a size-keyed `makeConverter: (CGSize) -> any NormalizedGeometryConverting` with a single `GeometryReader` as the measurement point; `PlayerLayerConverter` is retired (its math folded into `VideoGeometry`); iOS live capture keeps delegating to `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer` via `PreviewLayerConverter`. The macOS overlay blank was caused by feeding `AVPlayerLayer.videoRect` (an AppKit bottom-left value) into top-left Canvas math; the fix computes `displayRect` in pure SwiftUI space from `AVPlayerItem.presentationSize`.

### 2026-05-25 — Self-describing detections (geometry + readout ride on `Detection`)

M5·P3 needed the generic overlay to draw skeletons and honest numerics without learning per-detector domain knowledge. Decision: that knowledge rides **on the `Detection` value**, not in the overlay and not (for rendering) in `DetectorCapabilities`. Vision returns only a flat `[JointName: Joint]` dictionary with no edges, so the producing detector stamps the **skeleton edge topology** (`Detection.skeleton: Skeleton?` — name-keyed `Skeleton.Edge`s; the generic `Skeleton` type lives in the Detection domain, the canonical `humanBodyPose` instance lives *with* the detector that produces it) and a **meaningful numeric readout** (`Detection.readout: Readout?` — rectangle aspect ratio, pose joint count; never a fabricated `%`). `DetectionLayer` then dispatches **skeleton → quad → box** and renders whatever each detection carries (every point through the centralized `converter`, no re-derived Y-flip); the default `OverlayStyle.labelFormat` surfaces `readout` and never emits confidence. Capabilities stays the source of truth for *tuning UI + the P4 inspector*; *rendering* is driven by the self-describing detection — the two are complementary projections, not competitors. Rationale: keeps the overlay decoupled (CLAUDE.md invariant) with no `sourceModelID → capabilities` registry plumbed into the view; the cost (type-level topology riding on instances) is absorbed by copy-on-write shared storage. Rejected: topology on capabilities (needs that plumbing) and overlay-hardcoded body-pose adjacency (couples the generic overlay to one detector's domain).

### 2026-05-24 — Detector capability model (M5)

Built-in Vision detectors differ along axes a flat `[Detection]` can't express, so each detector declares a **capability descriptor** — the single source of truth for tuning UI, overlay rendering, and the raw-data inspector. Axes: **(1) geometry kind** (a *set*: box / quad / keypoints / contour / mask / heatmap / labelOnly / scalar); **(2) confidence semantics** — `probabilistic` / `perElement` / `none` / `derivedScalar(label:)`, never a bare `confidence: Float` that fabricates certainty; **(3) tunable-knob set** (reuses `SettingSchema`); **(4) introspectable field set**. Renderability (P3) and inspectability (P4) are two *projections* of the same descriptor, so they can't drift. `derivedScalar(label:)` is how geometric detectors surface a labeled quality ratio (rectangle quadrature deviation / aspect) without it masquerading as confidence. Proven on rectangles (confidence `none`) + 2D human body pose (confidence `perElement`); requires `SettingKind.string` + `.enum` additions for text/symbology knobs.

### 2026-05-22 — Best-effort temporal match in `ResultStore.lookup` via timestamp-keyed cache

`ResultStore` is a `[CMTime: TimestampedDetections]` dictionary keyed on *quantized* asset-time buckets (default: one 30fps frame); `lookup(at:)` is nearest-neighbor within `min(2 × quantization, stale:)`. `DetectorPipeline.detect(in:cache:)` consults the cache via a `DetectionCache` protocol (in `Sources/Iris/Detection/`) before dispatching detectors — re-visiting an already-detected timestamp returns the cached detections without re-running inference. `PlaybackSource` uses `.bufferingNewest(3)` (not `(1)`) so seek-emitted and frame-step frames survive detector congestion; the original 2026-05-20 "Runtime frame pipeline" `.bufferingNewest(1)` contract is preserved for `CaptureSession`. No eviction policy in v1 — revisit when M5's dataset workflows want long-form footage handling.

### 2026-05-20 — Single SwiftPM target, folder-organized internally

Iris ships as one Swift package target with a single umbrella library product.
Components (`Capture`, `Playback`, `Detection`, `Overlay`, `Tuning`, `Dataset`)
are folders under `Sources/Iris/` that share `Frame`, `Detector`, and
coordinate-space conventions — not separate targets, not separate packages.
Splitting later (into separate SwiftPM targets, or into adapter repos as
companion packages) is a non-breaking change if module boundaries start
mattering.

### 2026-05-20 — Runtime frame pipeline

A `Source<Frame>` protocol sits upstream of `IrisCapture` and `IrisPlayback` so
both feed the same downstream pipeline. Detector and overlay code never branch
on where a frame came from. The contract is `AsyncStream<Frame>` with
`.bufferingNewest(1)` back-pressure, exposed publicly through an `AsyncSequence`
protocol so consumers don't depend on the concrete type. The framework does
**not** spawn per-frame `Task`s — the consumer owns task lifetime through
`for await`, and structured-task cancellation flows through naturally.

### 2026-05-20 — Display pipeline

Overlay rendering is a SwiftUI `Canvas` with one centralized Y-flip. Coordinate
math lives behind a `NormalizedGeometryConverting` protocol with per-source
backends: preview-layer-backed for live capture (delegating to
`AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer.layerRectConverted`), video-rect-backed for playback
(aspect-fit math against the player's video rect). Callers feed `[Detection]`
and never touch a flip transform or re-derive aspect-fit math.

### 2026-05-20 — Foundation Models scope: two protocols, not one

`Detector` (`image → [Detection]`) and `Captioner` (`image → text`) are separate
protocols. VLM backends conform to both rather than collapsing into a merged
super-protocol. Rationale: detection output (bounding boxes) and captioning
output (text) have non-overlapping shapes; forcing every detector to know about
text would break the protocol's single responsibility.

### 2026-05-20 — `@CaptureActor` in `IrisCapture`'s public API

`IrisCapture` is an `actor` with `nonisolated unownedExecutor` bound to a
`DispatchSerialQueue` (the working blueprint is Apple AVCam's `CaptureService`).
The only nonisolated opening is `nonisolated let previewSource` — everything
else crosses the actor boundary as `async`. This isolation does **not** extend
to `Detector`: detectors have their own concurrency story (`Sendable` protocol;
stateful conformers wrap state in an internal `actor`).

→ [`explorations/swift-ecosystem/RECOMMENDATIONS.md`](../explorations/swift-ecosystem/RECOMMENDATIONS.md) (Apple AVCam blueprint)

### 2026-05-20 — Hot-swap by replacing the instance

To swap a model or detector mid-session, construct a fresh instance and replace
the reference — never reach into a running detector to mutate its model.
`Detector: Sendable`; stateless conformers are `struct`, stateful (e.g.
trajectory detection that needs cross-frame memory) are `actor`. `VNCoreMLModel`
is cached *outside* the detector so teardown only rebuilds the lightweight
request, not the model itself.

→ [`explorations/prior-projects/RECOMMENDATIONS.md`](../explorations/prior-projects/RECOMMENDATIONS.md)

### 2026-05-20 — `DetectorCache` is an injectable instance

`DetectorCache` lives as a `private let` on whatever owns the pipeline or
session, not as a global singleton. Singleton caches cross-contaminate when
multiple detectors run concurrently and break test isolation. Each pipeline
gets its own cache; the cost is negligible because models hash to the same
keys.

→ [`explorations/swift-ecosystem/RECOMMENDATIONS.md`](../explorations/swift-ecosystem/RECOMMENDATIONS.md)

### 2026-05-20 — Strict-concurrency escape hatches

`@preconcurrency import AVFoundation` and `@unchecked Sendable + NSLock +
documented invariant` are the legitimate escape hatches for AVFoundation,
Vision, and CoreML types that aren't Sendable-clean. Forbid plain
`@unchecked Sendable` without a documented locking invariant — that's silencing
the checker, not satisfying it. No Combine in public API: Iris is greenfield,
so there's no retrofit cost to skipping it.

→ [`explorations/swift-ecosystem/RECOMMENDATIONS.md`](../explorations/swift-ecosystem/RECOMMENDATIONS.md)

### 2026-05-20 — macOS parity is a *principle*, not a target

Files compile and render correctly on both iOS and macOS from the moment
they're written. `#if os(iOS)` is reserved for whole-subsystem platform gates
(the entire `Sources/Iris/Capture/` folder is iOS-only); it is never used to
fork the API shape of a single type that exists on both platforms.
Retrofitting macOS later is dramatically more expensive than doing it right
the first time — sportvision proves a 170-line SwiftUI overlay works unchanged
on both; counter-examples in the prior art show what happens when you don't.

### iOS 26 / iPadOS 26 / macOS 26 floor with Swift 6 strict concurrency

The platform floor is driven by four concrete capabilities only available at
this version: the new Vision Swift API (native async/await, Sendable, no Obj-C
bridge); the Foundation Models framework (on-device LLM access); `@Observable`
parity across iOS/macOS; and Swift 6.2 concurrency defaults. Dropping the floor
means losing one of these and rebuilding it by hand. Rationale lives in the
brief.
