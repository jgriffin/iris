penciled in — not yet defined (ideas, traceable to you)
   ✏️ M7 — Dataset (BRIEF §6)                                                          ← likely next
   ✏️ Source orientation correctness — playback preferredTransform + capture front-mirror (M5·P6)
   ✏️ Offline file-reader pre-pass → pre-computed detection tracks for smooth playback (backlog)

👉 next — milestone boundary: **decide the next milestone**. M7 (Dataset) is the next milestone-path entry — define it → draft [features/M7.md](./features/M7.md). (The M5·P6 orientation-correctness carryover is a smaller alternative if a quick win is preferred.) → [LOG.md](./LOG.md)

❓ open → [QUESTIONS.md](./QUESTIONS.md)
- ⚖️ Multi-detector pipelines under `TuningModel` (multi-active selection defers here)
- ⚖️ "What if?" mode (BRIEF §5)
- 🗓 RF-DETR Core ML spike — off the M6 critical path (direct PyTorch→Core ML fork, FP32, needs `DETRSetPredictionDecoder`)
- 🗓 Playback portrait `preferredTransform` + capture front-mirror (`isVideoMirrored`) — M5·P6 carryover
- 🗓 Offline file-reader pre-pass → pre-computed detection tracks for smooth playback (backlog)
- 🗓 `Apps/project.yml` ↔ `.pbxproj` drift — an xcodegen regen would drop the bundled `.mlpackage` Resources entries; the hand-edited `.pbxproj` is authoritative (M6·P3)
- 🗓 Path-B file-picking — file-picked models accept Path-A only; a Path-B picked model needs a label-supply UI + output-spec auto-detect (M6·P3)
- 🗓 Revisit bumped SwiftLint thresholds once detector churn settles
- ℹ️ Pre-existing DetectionInspector Swift 6 warning in both demos (M5·P6)

📌 recent → [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md)
- M6 closed: P1–P3 ✅; captioning (P4) dropped — Foundation Models is text-only, on-device captioning needs a VLM (2026-05-26)
- M6·P3 closed: model loading (prewarm, bundled-at-launch, file-picked Path-A) shipped (2026-05-26)
- M6·P3: path-B YOLOEnd2EndDecoder + runtime confidence knob (conditional TunableDetector) shipped (2026-05-26)
- M6·P2: Path-A CoreMLDetector shipped; runtime thresholds deferred to P3 (2026-05-26)
- Core ML detector: start with YOLOv12 (Path A), pluggable `OutputDecoder` seam (2026-05-25)
- VideoGeometry = single coordinate-mapping authority; orientation/mirroring upstream (2026-05-25)
- Self-describing detections (skeleton + readout on `Detection`) (2026-05-25)
