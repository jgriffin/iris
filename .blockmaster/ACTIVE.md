## 🟡 [m0-explorations](.blockmaster/blocks/260520-m0-explorations.md) — Upfront explorations before code starts

milestone · branch main · created 2026-05-20 · 0 active children · 2 recently closed
Pick-up-here: Both children closed — `survey-dev-folder` ✅ shortlisted 5 projects; `review-prior-projects` ✅ deep-read all 5 and wrote `explorations/prior-projects/{ios-videoCapture, PRVisionSpike, yolo-ios-app, sportvision, action-and-vision, SYNTHESIS, RECOMMENDATIONS}.md`. Ready to close M0 and move to M1 capture planning, optionally after a `BRIEF.md` refresh to fold in the resolved open questions (Q1 async, Q2 `@CaptureActor`, Q4 swap-instance, Q5 macOS parity) and the 7 M1-scope additions surfaced in `RECOMMENDATIONS.md`.

### ✅ [survey-dev-folder](.blockmaster/blocks/260520-survey-dev-folder.md) — Survey ~/dev/ for camera / capture / detection prior art

research · closed 2026-05-20
Outcome: Shortlist of 5 deep-read candidates (PR/ios-videoCapture, PR/PRVisionSpike, ml/yolo-ios-app, ml/sportvision, pocketRadar/BuildingAFeatureRichApp…). Full sweep covered 24 top-level folders + 5 recursed category folders; 9 had signal, 4 low-value entries dropped.

### ✅ [review-prior-projects](.blockmaster/blocks/260520-review-prior-projects.md) — Deep-read shortlisted prior projects

research · closed 2026-05-20
Outcome: 5 per-project notes + `SYNTHESIS.md` (verdicts on `BRIEF.md`'s 6 M1 open questions) + `RECOMMENDATIONS.md` (actionable patterns with code pointers) under `explorations/prior-projects/`. Strong verdicts: `@CaptureActor` in `IrisCapture` public API; SwiftUI `Canvas` overlay with one centralized Y-flip gives macOS parity for free; `Detector` is a `Sendable` protocol with mixed `struct`/`actor` conformers, hot-swap by replacing the instance, `VNCoreMLModel` cached outside detectors. 7 additions proposed for M1 scope (most notably `Detector.warmup()`, letterbox/pillarbox alignment, `.bufferingNewest(1)` back-pressure, `Frame.timestamp` first-class). Still open: COCO vs YOLO sidecar; Foundation Models scope; `Source` protocol unification; cancellation policy.
