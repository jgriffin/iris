// MARK: - PlaybackController

/// `@MainActor @Observable` SwiftUI-facing layer over a
/// [`PlaybackSource`](./PlaybackSource.swift). Mirrors the
/// [`ResultStore`](../Overlay/ResultStore.swift) doctrine — a sibling
/// observable wrapper, not a remodel of the underlying source.
///
/// **Why a sibling, not making `PlaybackSource` itself `@Observable`.**
/// `PlaybackSource` is `@unchecked Sendable` with `NSLock`-guarded state
/// because its tick driver invokes `tick()` from off-MainActor contexts
/// (`TaskTickDriver` runs on a detached `Task`, `DisplayLinkTickDriver`
/// runs on the display-link callback). Lifting the source to `@MainActor`
/// would require the tick path to hop into MainActor on every frame —
/// pure overhead that breaks the "no per-frame `Task` spawn" decision in
/// [`plans/DECISIONS.md`](../../../plans/DECISIONS.md) §"Runtime frame
/// pipeline". A sibling controller keeps the source's threading model
/// intact while giving SwiftUI views the observable bindings they need.
///
/// **Observation sources.**
/// - `currentTime`: `AVPlayer.addPeriodicTimeObserver` at ~30 Hz. The
///   callback fires on the main queue, so the property write stays
///   on-MainActor without a re-hop.
/// - `state`: forwarded from `PlaybackSource.state`. Refreshed on every
///   `togglePlay` / `seek` / `step` call and on `play()` / `pause()`
///   completion. The source already handles the canonical state
///   transitions; the controller mirrors them rather than re-deriving.
/// - `duration`: KVO on `AVPlayerItem.duration`. Becomes valid after
///   `.readyToPlay`; the slider treats `.indefinite` / `.invalid` as
///   "no track yet".
///
/// **`Scrubber` is wired against `ScrubberModel`, not this class.** That
/// keeps the preview path AVF-free; this is the production conformer.
